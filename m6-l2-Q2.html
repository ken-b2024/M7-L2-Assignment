        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Preheat your camping grill to medium heat, or about 375–400°F. Set aside enough single aluminum sheets to surround each intended s’more. That’s right — you’ll be baking each one nuzzled in its own cozy metal cocoon, forming toasty hearths that will ooze that sweet satisfaction.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>As you wait on the grill, start your s’mores by snapping in half lengthwise those graham crackers. Continue onto your chocolate bars by halving them, too; if using Hershey’s chocolate, we still recommend half the bar per s’more, each set atop one cracker half per treat.</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>This time, we’re bucking tradition by assembling the s’more before it hits the heat. Load up marshmallows on the bare cracker half of your treats — if using caramel, drizzle that over the marshmallows now — then stack those raw s’mores together. Surrounded each one with aluminum foil until you have a small fleet of lightly-wrapped metal treats.</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Is the grill ready? Then so are you! Place the foil-wrapped desserts on the cooking grates and grill for 2–3 minutes, or until the marshmallows are melted.</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Remove and serve quickly, with or without powdered sugar over the top. Be sure to ditch the hot foil and offer them plated, buffet-style, or on individual napkins — great for the plates, better for the aftermath!</p>
